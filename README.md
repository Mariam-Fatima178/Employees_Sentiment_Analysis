# Employee Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
Employee Sentiment Analysis project focused on analyzing internal email communications to evaluate employee engagement, sentiment trends, and potential flight risks. This project was completed as part of an evaluation task at **Springer Capital** using NLP and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- Transformers (BERT)

## Key Features
- Classified employee messages into **Positive, Negative, and Neutral** using a BERT-based sentiment model.
- Generated **monthly sentiment scores** and ranked employees to monitor engagement trends.
- Identified **employees at potential flight risk** based on negative sentiment frequency.
- Applied **regression analysis** to evaluate sentiment trends and support HR decision-making.

## Results
### Top Positive Email Senders
- sally.beck@enron.com  
- lydia.delgado@enron.com  
- johnny.palmer@enron.com  

### Top Negative Email Senders
- bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com  
- sally.beck@enron.com  
- john.arnold@enron.com  

### Employees at Risk
1. bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com  
2. rhonda.denton@enron.com  
3. sally.beck@enron.com  

## Insights
- Most communications were **neutral**, indicating a formal communication style.
- **Positive sentiment outweighed negative**, suggesting generally healthy employee engagement.
- A rise in negative sentiment was observed from **mid-2010 to early-2011**, indicating potential organizational stress.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **BERT-based NLP models** and **trend analysis** can uncover actionable insights from employee communications and support proactive HR strategies.
